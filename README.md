##                                story why we select to work on this project
When I was At compus  almost all my Friends ware software Engineering students.<br>so when they talk about their projects I was wonder how is  this possible. <br>But at that time I was on another department  and  I have not enough time to study both the departments at the same time.<br>so I decide to finish the department I was started then I was planning to study  software Engineering. <br>I was watching  them working a lot of project but I was shock the project they were talking about the weather application.<br>it riases a lot of questions about the weather application.<br>like how is the accourate data comes from, how it works for all the cities of the world,<br> how do I know the weathers of the cities and other lot of questions.<br>so at that time I decide if I start learnig software Engineering weather application will be my first project.
