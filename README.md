This project helps users to stay informed about weather conditions and make better decisions based on that information<br>and The team members are Esayas Aregawi and Rahwa Legesse since the project is mainly focused on front end design<br> 
we worked together as a team.Thus uses for all customers over the world.
##            story why we select to work on this project 

When I was At compus  almost all my Friends ware software Engineering students.<br>so when they talk about their projects I was wonder how is  this possible. <br>But at that time I was on another department  and  I have not enough time to study both the departments at the same time.<br>so I decide to finish the department I was started then I was planning to study  software Engineering. <br>I was watching  them working a lot of project but I was shock the project they were talking about the weather application.<br>it riases a lot of questions about the weather application.<br>like how is the accourate data comes from, how it works for all the cities of the world,<br> how do I know the weathers of the cities and other lot of questions.<br>so at that time I decide if I start learnig software Engineering weather application will be my first project.

##    we use the following Technologies for our portofilo project**
 **- For the Frontend we chose to use HTML,CSS and JavaScript<br>**
 **- For the backend part we use Javascript and API<br>**
 **- we use user Interface(UI) and user Experience(UX)<br>**
 **- after we finish working the project we will use Tester**
 ## overview of features weâ€™ve completed
 * **The website is responsive and compatible with mobile.This means users can access the project from a mobile view.<br>**
 * **The website works for all locations of the world.<br>**
 * **The website is easy for users to access.it has not login(logout)part.so it takes little time to understand and access**
   ## Technical Challenges we faced
   After we finish our front end part, we decide to go fetching of data from ApI sources like Api open weathermap.<br>then we enter to the website of Api weathermap and we create Account first and verify our email. <br>Then we create key value after that we go to the ApI and we select the Current Weather Data API DOC.After we enter to that page <br>we need to select the Api with city name, but there was no Api call with city name.<br> But we watch a lot of videos with the page of Api call with city name. so this was one of our first technical challenge.<br> But we continue using with longitude and latitude of the city to get the data of the cities temperature, pressure,<br> speed, humidty and others using the images of the above lists features. <br>So we copy the Api call and the keyvalue and we toke these values to the browser. We never realized that<br> it takes about 15 minute to fetch API data. We thought that was error and we tried to solve it.that was very challenging until we got sources from YouTube
   **we learn a lot of things from the website**
  like java Script is you website easy.
**What you might do differently?** Implement smart notifications that remind users to take necessary actions based on weather conditions.<br> For instance, notifying users to carry an umbrella if rain is expected or advising precautions against extreme heat.<br> And Offer users the ability to explore past and future weather conditions through interactive maps.
